Type make to compile the code.
To run the code type ./simpleprogram, click enter and input an int; which will represent the number of threads to create.
If you type 0 or a non int the code returns nothing. If you type in 4.3 then the code rounds it off as 4.
To run the sync version of part 1 comment out any line that has #ifdef and #endif.
